            <p class="ziczac text-center">I strongly believe, the willingness of learning in life is a Choice and I've made the choice of learning codes! I've earned a certificate of Professional Web Development from Programming Hero by Jhankar Mahbub where i've made some marvelous full-stack websites for those you can give a sight to my github repositories. I've done my graduation in HR from North South University, Bangladesh and suddenly shifted my mind to learn programming and be a successful Web-developer. Other than that, I'm interested in gardening, travelling. Trying new things gives me a meaning to my life! </p>
